# preRecoil_aiming_Fortnite
This is a simple tool to lower your crosshair when aiming so that the recoil that the gun makes will move the crosshair to the area you want to aim.
Also, this is not some advanced Fortnite hack script. Just a simple tool to minimise recoil messing up your shots. Forks are ok as im not a good coder myself and would love some suggestions on how to improve.
Oh and also if you get warned or banned or if anything happens to your account its not my fault, so do it at your own risk. But ur prob fine cuz you can do this even without the tool by just aiming lower when shooting. Still, do this at your own risk.
